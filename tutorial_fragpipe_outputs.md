### Guide to FragPipe results

Output files will depend on the [workflow](https://msfragger.nesvilab.org/tutorial_fragpipe_workflows.html) used and how experiments/groups are set on the 'Workflow' tab. This page lists the different output files generated by FragPipe. Main report files are either comma-separated (csv) or tab-separated (tsv), and their column contents are described here.

Log files are saved automatically (with a timestamp) if an analysis finishes successfully, but they are can also be exported (with the 'Export Log' button on the 'Run' tab) to help with troubleshooting if an analysis fails.

FragPipe also uses various configuration and intermediate files, those that are not 'cleaned up' at the end of an analysis are listed here.

Also see our [guide to using FragPipe](https://msfragger.nesvilab.org/tutorial_fragpipe.html).

#### global.profile.tsv
##### **global.profile.tsv** reports the most prominent features from [PTM-Shepherd](https://ptmshepherd.nesvilab.org/) analysis of mass shifts observed from FDR-filtered open search results. Each row corresponds to a different detected mass shift. Unless otherwise indicated, values are summed from all datasets in the analysis. Column contents are listed below.

**peak_apex** apex of the detected delta mass peak (in Da)

**peak_lower** lower bound of the detected peak (Da), determined by precursor tolerance or the detection of an adjacent peak

**peak_upper** upper bound of the detected peak (Da), determined by precursor tolerance or the detection of an adjacent peak

**PSMs** the number of PSMs contained within the peak boundary (bin), reported for each dataset if multiple datasets are used as input

**peak_signal** relative measure of peak prominence/quality. In noisy regions of the delta mass histogram, values are penalized 

**percent_also_in_unmodified** the percentage of PSMs in this mass bin with a corresponding PSM in the unmodified bin

**mapped_mass_1** primary modification annotation derived from [Unimod](https://www.unimod.org/modifications_list.php), all isobaric modifications listed and separated by “/”

**mapped_mass_2** if the delta mass peak is a combination of two masses, a second modification annotation is listed here. As with mapped_mass_1, all isobaric modifications are listed and separated by “/”

**similarity** MS/MS spectral similarity of modified peptides compared to their unmodified counterparts. When multiple modified-unmodified comparisons are done for a single peptide, these cosine similarity scores are averaged for the peptide. The peptide scores are then averaged across all peptides in the mass shift bin. These comparisons are only done for peptides of the same charge state.

**rt_shift** retention time shift comparing modified peptides to their unmodified counterparts. When multiple modified-unmodified comparisons are done for a single peptide, the retention time shifts are averaged for the peptide. The peptide shifts are then averaged across all peptides in the mass shift bin. Individual comparisons are only done for peptides in the same LC-MS run. Units are usually seconds but can vary by instrument type

**localized_PSMs** number of PSMs for this delta mass that showed at least one additional matched ion when the mass shift is placed on a residue

**n-term_localization_rate** percentage of PSMs with an uninterrupted string of localized residues from the N-terminus. This is calculated differently from other enrichment scores due to the difference in assumptions underlying N-terminal and residue-specific localization, so these values cannot be directly compared to the amino acid enrichment scores.

**AA1** amino acid/residue most enriched (most likely to harbor the mass shift) compared to other residues

**AA1_enrichment_score** equivalent to the odds the delta mass is localized to AA1 compared to other residues

**AA1_psm_count** weighted number of PSMs where the mass shift localized to AA1. Shifts localizing to multiple residues are divided by the number of localized residues in the spectra, so this is an estimated number of PSMs localized to a particular residue

(AA2 and AA3 statistics)

**<sample>_PSMs** number of PSMs with a mass shift in this bin

**<sample>\_percent_PSMs** number of PSMs from the previous column as a percentage of total PSMs

**<sample>_peptides** number of unique peptide sequences with a mass shift in this bin

**<sample>\_percent_also_in_unmodified** percentage of peptide sequences with a mass shift in this bin that are also found in the zero mass shift bin

**Theoretical Mass Shift** The theoretical mass of the modification from [Unimod](https://www.unimod.org/modifications_list.php) if annotated, or the peak apex of an unannotated modification

**<sample>_PSMs** Number of PSMs with the modification, including any row from the global.profile.tsv file where the modification appears (e.g., a 'Methylation' entry in the will include PSMs corresponding to both 'Methylation' and 'Methylation + First isotopic peak')
